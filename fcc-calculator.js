Free Code Camp - Build a JS Calculator
Created by Patrick Burns (2017-01-17 - )

TODO - Basic Calculator UI
        -Buttons (0-9, ., plus, minus, mult, div, equal, clear)
        -Text based Input, Current Expression, and Result Fields

TODO - User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
        -Clickable buttons
        -Mapping clicks to input, expression
        -Current Input and Expression populate as I click numbers
        -Result generated when I hit equal

TODO - User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
        -Clear button wipes Input, expression, and result

TODO - User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
        -Order of operations handler (library for this?)

TODO - Style UI
